# About Me

I'm a software engineer at Amazon with a passion for the intersection of technology, machine learning, and mathematics. 

When I'm not working at work, I'm experimenting with new concepts and bullying myself into learning new things. I enjoy breaking complex ideas into digestible pieces and sharing them with the world.

I built this site using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/), a lightning-fast static site generator that keeps things clean and simple.

This space serves as a collection of thoughts, experiments, and learnings I'm cultivating along my tech journey. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to connect if something catches your interest.
