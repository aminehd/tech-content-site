Are you a technical indivisuall? Are you stunt by technology? 
Do you feel like it is impossible to learn anything new and fun?
Then Checkout my posts here or else I black main you!

I promise I post every once in a while and you are going to kinda like my posts. 
At least you won't hate them.

If things go well, I will make it to a newsletter. 
I might even start messing with custom domain stuff and make a fancy domain name for this (something fun like amd.aminehd)
