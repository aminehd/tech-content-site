Are you technical? Do you feel stunt by it? 
Do you feel like it is impossible to learn anything new and fun?
Then Checkout my posts here!

I promise I post every once in a while and my post are going to find them semi-decent. 
At least you won't hate them.

If things go well, I might turn it to a newsletter. 
I might even start messing with custom domain stuff and pick a fancy domain name for this (something like amd.aminehd ... totally daydreaming).
